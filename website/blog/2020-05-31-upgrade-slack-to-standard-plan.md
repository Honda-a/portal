Today, I've upgraded Slack to paid plan.

There are 34 members, including Inactive and Active. 
Because of the historic reason, the inner motivations of members are different. 
It brings the difficulty to have a consensus and leading the community one step forward. 

Slack is a good communication platform. 
After the COVID-19, it gets more popular. 

It still have disadadvantages though. 
Their customers are mainly Piramid company. Not a community, or SpherIO.
*SpherIO is form of the collaboration.  

There're other alternatives. Riot, Gitter, especially Discord. 
Many communies abroad switch to Discord because of the decentralized features.
However at this stage, the functions they provides are inferior to Slack's paid plan. 

Thus I switched to the paid plan. 
It's because Udemy's video will be the small income for the community. 
It's very small but big step. 0 and 1 is tottally different. 

Slack has a plan for Nonprofits. However it looks they need a legal certificate. 
Not for a community. It may happen, but in my opinion, achievements are not enough.
