# Aragon project updates: July 2020

Hey everyone!

July was a month with many things happening all across the ecosystem, with a strong focus on developer experience and liquidity.

## ANT liquidity rewards 🤑

We are thrilled to announce Aragon's first foray into ANT liquidity rewards. Following in the footsteps of other great DeFi projects such as [Synthetix][1], that pioneered the concept of liquidity rewards, the Aragon Association has decided to launch our own ANT liquidity rewards program.

The rewards clock starts ticking **Wed July 22nd at 3pm UTC**. Even before that, liquidity on Uniswap has skyrocketed! [Participate →][2]

## Hack for Freedom is on fire 🔥

More than 20 teams are working on building next-generation DAOs and tools.

## More and more projects #PoweredByAragon 🚀

Curve Finance was the latest addition in the DeFi pack to [announce they are using Aragon][6]. Pillar Wallet also announced [their Aragon DAO][7].

### Aragon tops the charts for DAO platforms 🏆

### ANT on Messari 🔍

We knew being transparent was a must ever since our token sale in May 2017.

Fast forward to today, we are very happy with our investment in transparency. Trust is something you cannot measure, but you know it's there.

The Aragon Association wants to continue building on that trust. That is why we are happy to announce that ANT has joined the Messari Disclosures Registry.
