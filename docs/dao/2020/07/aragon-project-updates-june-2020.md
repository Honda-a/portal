# Aragon project updates: June 2020

## Aragon Connect got released ⚡️

Connect is the #1 thing that Aragon users have asked us for. Now it's here!

## Hack for Freedom, an Aragon Connect hackathon 

Hack for Freedom is a virtual hackathon celebrating developers creating tools for **grassroots collaboration**. The current global **social unrest** is a cry for help, and Web3 tools, specifically **DAOs**, could be extremely helpful.

Thanks to Aragon Connect, developers can now **embed DAO functionality into their apps in just a few lines of code**. This gives developers unprecedented power to create tools for social change.

Hack for Freedom will be happening July 6th to July 19th as a part of DAO Hack Month in collaboration with MetaGame's Fork the World hackathon. [Check it out →][1]
