**UBI communities**

\- Easy interface where you can see the total stable coin balance of the piggybank, and request withdrawals that the group can approve. 

**Open source communities**

\- Webapp to show GitHub contribution rankings using [AraCred][19] and allowing people to make decisions on the project's roadmap by voting with their tokens. 

**Pokégon**

\- A copy of [Pokémol][20] — A place for people to browse Moloch DAO's, viewing members of a DAO, view balances, vote on proposals, and more. *Augmented with 3Box integration and threads for every proposal. See the working repo here: [Pokegon][21]. 

That's all for now, we can't wait to see what you build !
